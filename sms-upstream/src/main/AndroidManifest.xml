    SMS-UPSTREAM is a library module.

    All activities, receivers, services, and permissions are declared
    in the app module's manifest, NOT here.

    This manifest should remain minimal. When AOSP source is added,
    do NOT copy the AOSP AndroidManifest.xml here - it contains
    system-only permissions and components we cannot use.
